# PIR_motion_sensor
The project was done in IAR Workbench for MSP430 and Proteus simulation software.
A Motion detector based alarm was developed using modules of PIR Sensors, LED's and Buzzer. They were controlled using MSP430 microcontroller.
The buzzer would ring if more than 5 seconds of activity was detected by the PIR Sensor.
The developed model can be used in security surviellance systems.
